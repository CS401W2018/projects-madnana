        <p>When should you use a background image, and when should you use the IMG tag?</p>
        <p> Img tag is related to the content, meaning it creates a holding space for the referenced image we link in the website, however, background-image is related to the design, meaning, when your intention is to enhance the aesthetics of elements by styling them with images, such as using them for background..</p>
