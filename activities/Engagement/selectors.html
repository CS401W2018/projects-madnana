        <div>
            <p id="first">List out the different ways to select an item.<br>You can use Tag Name, Descendent, <span class="bigger">ID</span> and Class.
            </p>
        </div>
        <p id="second">What is the difference between an ID and a Class?<br>
        Id can only be used once, once you validate your html it is going to send an error, however, with class you can reuse it as many times as you want.</p>
        <p class="third">What is the difference between a SPAN tag and a DIV tag?<br> div element is used for block-level organization, it causes linebreaks. The span tag is an in-line element with no semantic meaning, usually meant to style sections of a page</p>
        <p class="golden bigger">What is the difference between a DIV tag and HEADER, MAIN, FOOTER?<br>
        They are all similar to DIV tag and have the same function. Instead of giving div for everything on the page, we now have clear names to separate our contents, and it is not necessary to put ID on every division.</p>
        <p id="fifth">What are different ways to select a color?<br>RGB values and the color options from Visual Studio.</p>
