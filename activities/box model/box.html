                <h2>Block Tags</h2>
                <p> 
                    What is the difference between block tags and inline tags.<br>
                    Block tags take up the full width of their container and always start on a new line. They control larger sections of the layout.Inline tags only take up as much space as their content and stay on the same line as other inline elements.<br>
                    What is the margin, border, and padding?<br>
                    Margin: The space outside an element's border. It separates the element from other elements.<br>
                    Border: The line that goes around the padding and content of an element.<br>
                    Padding: The space between the element's content and its border.
                    <br>
                    What are units of measurement you can use in CSS?<br>
                    px (pixels): Fixed size, used for precise control.<br>
                    em and rem: Relative to the font size (of the parent or root element).<br>
                    % (percent): Relative to the parent element's size.<br>
                    vh and vw: Viewport height and width, based on the size of the browser window.<br>
                    When would you use a figure tag?<br>
                    ou use the figure tag when you want to group media content (like an image or a video) along with a caption. As the example down below.
                </p>
