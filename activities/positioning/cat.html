            What is the difference between a block and an inline tag? Give examples of each one.<br>
            <em>Block elements have top and bottom margins. Inline elements don't have a top and bottom margin.<br> 
            Example of block elements: &lt;p&gt;<br>
            Example of Inline tag: &lt;span&gt;</em><br>
            What is normal flow in HTML?<br>
            <em>It is the way that Block and Inline elements are displayed on a page before any changes are made to their layout.<br></em>
            What does float do? Why do you need to clear the float?<br>
            <em>The float property is used for positioning and formatting content.
            We need to clear the float property to control the floating elements and prevent from overlapping.<br></em>
            What do absolute, fixed, and relative do?<br>
            <em>Relative - the element is positioned relative to its normal position.<br> 
            Absolute - the element is positioned absolutely to its first positioned parent.<br>
            Fixed - the element is positioned related to the browser window.<br>
            </em>
            How can you make nice navigation buttons for mobile devices?<br>
            <em>We can use a combination of CSS properties like flexbox and media queries.</em><br>
            Where can you find videos to review what we talked about in class?<br>
            <em>In modules, the content is organized by topic, including videos(lecture Notes), engagement activities, and a project related to that subject.</em>
