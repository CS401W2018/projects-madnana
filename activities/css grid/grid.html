                <p>How much time should you spend on an engagement assignment after class? <br>
                    <em>We should be spending maximum of 30-45 minutes on answering the questions if not completing the engagement assignment in class. We can practice and study outside of class, but the assignment itself shouldn't take very long.</em><br>
                    What should you focus on during class and after class?<br>
                    <em>We should focus on understanding and following along with the explanation & demonstration in class, and after class we can go back to the lecture videos and review what was explained if we have any questions.</em><br>
                    What is the main difference between CSS Grid and CSS Flex?<br>
                    <em>flexbox was designed for layout in one dimension. It is either a row or a column. However, Grid was designed for two-dimensional layout It is both rows, and columns at the same time.</em>
