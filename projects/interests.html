        <h2>Horror Movies</h2>
        <p id="first">Something I have always liked since I was a little girl is horror movies. No matter how hard my parents tried, I always found a way to watch or read about them; they were simply too fascinating to me.</p>

        <p class="focus">However, as the years have passed, I've noticed a pattern in movies: they're not about fear anymore. Now, it's all about cheap jump scaresâ€”the momentary sense of surprise that fades in just two seconds. That's not true fear. Something is missing from these movies; the magic they once had is gone.<br>
        They rely too heavily on CGI, there are too many jump cuts, and the drama is often overdone. The stories have become predictable, making it hard to relate to the characters and immerse ourselves in their situations.
        </p>

        <p class="focus">Horror movies can be funny, action-packed, political, suspenseful, thrilling, artistic, and even depressing. They can cross into every genre. They don't need to rely on gore or violence; they can be based on real events or present a fresh perspective on a crazy and impossible situation. The famous "What if?" concept can lead to powerful storytelling. Unfortunately, this art seems to be fading, with fewer creators preserving that balance, and more relying on cheap thrills and fleeting shocks.
        <br>
        Some renowned directors and authors still manage to evoke that magical sensation of fear.<span class="bolder">The kind that grips you while allowing you to feel safe.</span> Even though we know it's only a movie or a book the fear lingers long after the movie/book is over.</p>

        <h2>Color Choices for Text Emphasis</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>What color did you choose to emphasize text?

                <span class="bolder">I made the words bolder and changed the font to emphasize important text.</span>  And the color I choose was (#a04747)
            </li>
    <li>What color did you choose to de-emphasize text? 
        <span class="focus">I chose a soft  yellowish color (#a38245) to de-emphasize less important text.</span>
    </li>
    <li>How did you choose your colors? Did you use a tool online to help you find colors?
        <span>I used an online color palette (ColorHunt) the website as multiple options and ideas of colors that complemented.</span>
    </li>
