    <h1>A Day In Natalia's Life </h1>
    <hr>
    <p>My name is Natalia, and I’m originally from Brazil. 
        I have two older brothers who keep life fun and light. 
        I’m currently pursuing a major in computer science at 
        BYUH, which means I will spend many nights <em>crying</em> 
        while working on my code. In my free time, I enjoy playing 
        video games, which provides a great escape and a way to 
        unwind after a long day, as long as it is 
        <strong>not</strong> a ranked game. I also like playing 
        volleyball, which keeps me active and helps me get up and 
        stretch my legs. It is also a good reminder that I am 
        currently sedentary.</p>
    <p>Balancing my studies, work and hobbies keeps me busy and sleepy, 
        but I find joy in the little things with my <mark>family</mark> 
        and exploring Hawaii with my friends. I'm currently on a mission on finding good food 
        in the Laie area, and one of my favorite place's right know is Deez Bowl's in Kahuku. 
        Nothing beats eating garlic shrimp watching a Stephen King's movie adaptation &lt3,
         when I was 11 years old, I thought we were going to marry, it took me longer than it 
         should to lose that hope. <em>My top 5 books from him are:</em> </p>

    <ol type = "A">
        <li>The Shinning </li>
        <li>Doctor Sleep </li>
        <li>Thinner </li>
        <li>The Green Mile </li>
        <li>The Mist</li>

    </ol>

    <p>Education is not just a path to personal achievement but a way to <strong>influence and improve the world.</strong> This is why I want to become something and why I am working hard to earn my diploma.I want to someday, <mark>contribute</mark> meaningfully to my field and to society. </p>
